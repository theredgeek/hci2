## Welcome to our study!

We are conducting a pilot study of our high-fidelity prototype to evaluate the design choices and, hopefully, improve based on the feedback.

This repository has a corresponding Google Forms where you will enter your answers and the tasks will be explained.

## App design:

Our AI application focuses on making the work of customer service (CS) employees easier and more efficient. The AI will closely cooperate with the CS agents - reading the incoming messages, categorising them, answering them, etc. – as a chatbot would. But sometimes, it can happen that AI will not be sure how exactly it should help; thus, it will send the message to its agent, who will be responsible for answering it. AI will learn from the agent’s answer, so then, in the future, it will be able to respond to such questions by itself.
